Hello Alex or Sai!

Compile with the command: make

Run the executable (hw3) with the absolute path of the test file you'd like to load the polyhedra with.

On running the executable you will see a GLUT window partitioned into 4 squares.
In the top left corner is the XY plane. In the top right is the XZ plane.
In the bottom left is the YZ plane.

In order to give the program input you must click on the GLUT window.

A prompt will be written to the screen giving you options.
