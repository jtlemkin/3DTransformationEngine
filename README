Hello Alex or Sai!

Compile with the command: make

Run the executable (hw2) with the absolute path of the test file you'd like to load the vertices with.

On running the executable you will see a GLUT window partitioned into 4 squares.
In the top left corner is the XY plane. In the top right is the XZ plane.
In the bottom left is the YZ plane.

In order to give the program input you must click on the GLUT window.

The range of polyhedra IDs will be printed to the screen and then you will be prompted to give
a command from the list of options.

Translate takes a Polygon ID, X, Y, Z values to translate the polygon by.
Rotate takes a Polygon ID, an angle in degrees, and points specifying P1 and P2 of a rotation axis.
Scales takes a Polygon ID and a scaling factor.

ex. transl 0 .5 .5 .5
ex. rot 1 45 0 0 0 1 1 1
ex. scale 0 2
